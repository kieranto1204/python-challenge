In order for this code to run properly, you will want to use gitbash and the command:

git clone https://github.com/kieranto1204/python-challenge.git

Make sure that you are running the code using a python terminal and that the program is not in restricted mode.

If you don't do this portion, then the file location that is specified in my main.py files will not work.

Note: You will see in the terminal that there are a bunch of ". " before the actual election results on the PyPoll code, this is because of the code on line 37-39, which I did not want to remove as it was a part of the starter file. Do note that the ". " are not reflected on the text file in the analysis folder.

The instructions for this assignment were to:

1. Create a repository called python-challenge
2. Clone that repository to our computer
3. Create a folder called PyBank and PyPoll, that both contain a file called main.py, and two folders. A resource folder to hold the .csv file from the starter code and an analysis file that will hold the .txt file that we will create in the challenge.

The instructions for the PyBank portion of the challenge were to:

1. Use the provided budget_data.csv file to create a script that analyzes the records to calculate:
2. Total number of months in the data set
3. Net total profit/loss over the entire period
4. Changes in profit/loss over the entire period (Average as well)
5. Greatest increase in profit over the entire period
6. Greatest decrease in profits over the entire period

The instructions for the PyPoll portion of the challenge were to:

1. Use the provided electoin_data.csv to create a script that analyzes the records to find:
2. The total number of votes cast
3. A list of candidates that received votes
4. The percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The total number of votes each candidate won
6. The winner of the election
